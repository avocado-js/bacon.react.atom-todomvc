This is an example of using React with
[bacon.react.html](https://github.com/polytypic/bacon.react.html) and
[Bacon.Model](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.model) to implement a reactive
model and UI.

To test locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polytypic/atomi-todomvc.git
cd atomi-todomvc
npm install
npm run build
```

and then point browser to `atomi-todomvc/public/index.html`.
